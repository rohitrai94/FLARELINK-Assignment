# Task Manager

Task Management App
This repository contains the source code for a Task Management Application built using React.js. The app is designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently, with features like task prioritization, filtering, and persistent storage using local storage.
________________________________________

Project Overview
The app provides a structured way to create, organize, and manage tasks. It uses React's state management to dynamically handle task operations and ensures tasks are saved in the browser's local storage for persistence.

How the Code Works
1. App Structure
The application is divided into multiple components for better readability and modularity:
â€¢	App.jsx: The main component that manages overall state and layout.
â€¢	Sidebar.jsx: Handles navigation, task filtering, and search functionality.
â€¢	TaskList.jsx: Displays the list of tasks and manages their rendering and behavior.
â€¢	TaskItem.jsx: Represents a single task, providing options to mark as complete or delete.
â€¢	App.css: Contains all the styles for the application.

2. Core Features and Their Implementation
a. Task Addition
Users can add tasks with the following attributes:
â€¢	ID (unique for each task).
â€¢	Text (task description).
â€¢	Completed (whether the task is done or not).
â€¢	Priority (High, Medium, or Low).
Code for adding a task is in TaskList.jsx:

const handleAddTask = () => {
  if (newTask.trim()) {
    addTask({ id: Date.now(), text: newTask, completed: false, priority });
    setNewTask('');
    setPriority('Medium');
  }
};
________________________________________
b. Task Storage
Tasks are saved in the browserâ€™s local storage using Reactâ€™s useEffect:

useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem('tasks', JSON.stringify(tasks));
}, [tasks]);
This ensures that all tasks persist even after the page is refreshed.
________________________________________
c. Task Prioritization
The app displays tasks based on their priority when the "Priority" tab is active. The sorting logic is:

const sortedTasks = [...filteredTasks].sort((a, b) => {
  const priorityOrder = { High: 1, Medium: 2, Low: 3 };
  return priorityOrder[a.priority] - priorityOrder[b.priority];
});
High-priority tasks appear at the top, followed by Medium and Low.
________________________________________
d. Task Filtering
The sidebar allows users to filter tasks by categories:
â€¢	All Tasks: Displays all tasks.
â€¢	Upcoming Tasks: Shows incomplete tasks.
â€¢	Completed Tasks: Displays only completed tasks.
â€¢	Priority Tasks: Orders tasks by their priority.
The filtering logic in App.jsx:

const filteredTasks = tasks.filter((task) => {
  if (activeTab === 'All') return true;
  if (activeTab === 'Completed') return task.completed;
  if (activeTab === 'Upcoming') return !task.completed;
  return true;
});
________________________________________
e. Task Search
Users can search for tasks using the search bar in the sidebar. The search query dynamically filters tasks based on their text:

const visibleTasks = sortedTasks.filter((task) =>
  task.text.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())
);
________________________________________
f. Task Completion
Tasks can be marked as completed or uncompleted by toggling their completed state:

const toggleComplete = (id) => {
  setTasks(
    tasks.map((task) =>
      task.id === id ? { ...task, completed: !task.completed } : task
    )
  );
};
________________________________________
g. Task Deletion
Users can delete tasks by clicking the delete icon:

const deleteTask = (id) => {
  setTasks(tasks.filter((task) => task.id !== id));
};

3. Component Interaction
â€¢	App.jsx:
o	Manages the overall state: tasks, searchQuery, and activeTab.
o	Provides state and functions as props to Sidebar and TaskList.
â€¢	Sidebar.jsx:
o	Handles filtering logic and search queries.
o	Allows toggling between tabs (e.g., All, Completed, Priority).
â€¢	TaskList.jsx:
o	Displays tasks based on the selected tab and search results.
o	Passes individual task operations (delete, complete) to TaskItem.
â€¢	TaskItem.jsx:
o	Renders each task with priority-specific styles.
o	Allows marking tasks as completed or deleting them.
